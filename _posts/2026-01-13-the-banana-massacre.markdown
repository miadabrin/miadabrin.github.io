# Intro
When I was younger, There was this book in my grandfather's library called "100 years of solitude" which I stole without permission and started reading.

There was this rather weird chapter about "Banana company" that had workers protesting for their rights. In the story the company is not able to silence the workers and government ends up sending the army and they kill every single worker. They get rid of their bodies and the memory of that event gets wiped out from the mind of the nation.

It was later in life that I realized that was a real story behind the [Banana Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Massacre) and they actually did that crime. If you look at the wikipedia page the number of people killed is estimated between 47 to 2000 because no one has an exact record of what happened. They killed all those people without anyone being able to report the events of that day.

## The massacre in Iran
on January 8 2026, people of Iran, in response to call to action of an opposition leader went into the streets to protest many years of crime and unfairness of Iranian government. The government shut-off internet and all communications and started the massacre of people of Iran. This was not the first time they were doing this but it is by far the most horrific instance of such massacre. At least 12000 people are estimated to have been murdered in cold blood. Just like the banana massacre, no one knows the exact number.

I woke up today to the voice of my sister calling from inside of Iran (using landline and a specific operator) crying and describing this horrific crime for about 60 seconds. This is one of those moments that I will never forget.

It is possibly one of the most atrocious acts of a government against its own nation in the history of humanity.

## The killing continues

At the time of writing this article, it has been 125 hours of no internet and limited news coming out of Iran. The only update people get is from limited phone calls that people make from inside the Iran from a landline on a specific operator. 

People are still being killed. The ones that got arrested will be hung shortly. 

My responsibility is to not let this be another Banana Massacre. The world needs to know.
