My name is Miad Abrin and I have been a Software Engineer / SRE for the last 11+ years. Being an SRE means you will deal with large scale issues and problems all the time and sometimes there is not enough information out there to help you in the darkest corners of the job. 

This blog is my attempt to help other engineers find their way into the sometimes complicated world of Devops and SRE. If you have any suggestions please shoot me an email to miadabrin @ gmail . com. Happy reading.
